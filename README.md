# Interactive Web Page

This is a single-file HTML project that demonstrates several interactive features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The entire project is contained within one `index.html` file for simplicity and easy deployment.

## Features

- **Color Changer:** A button that changes the background color of a section to a random color with each click.
- **Text Hider/Shower:** A button that toggles the visibility of a paragraph of text.
- **Custom Form Validation:** A contact form with client-side validation for required fields (Name, Email, Message) and a check for a valid email format, all implemented with JavaScript.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No web server is required as all the code is self-contained.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains all the HTML structure, embedded CSS styling within a `<style>` tag, and all the JavaScript logic within a `<script>` tag.
